Would you also like me to write an additional helper file like `utils/helpers.ts` for dropdown select or wait for visible?  
(Let me know â€” can share quickly.)  
Otherwise, this setup is **ready to use now**!  
Just paste these files, install npm packages, and start running!  

**Shall I also share a short sample `npx playwright test` command output to show how it'll look after running?** (Would be useful for your recording!)
